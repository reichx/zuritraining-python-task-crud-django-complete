Zuri Training - Python Task - CRUD in Django (Completed)

A Blog App created using the Django framework which has been extended by adding new features, such as:
-    a register/sign-up page (where new users can register/create a new account). 
-    a login page (which authenticates registered users against the database)
-    a password reset feature (which allows users to reset their password via email)
-    a logout feature (which logs out the currently logged in user)
-    a comment section (which allows only logged in users to leave comments on blog posts)

The project has been hosted on Heroku and is available vis this URL:
